## 🧮 Age Calculator App

A simple and responsive app that allows the user to input a date and discover how much time has passed since that date until today.

### 🚀 Technologies Used
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Redux

### 🛠️ How I Built It

- When the app loads, the **day input field is automatically focused**, so the user can start typing right away — no need to click or tap.
  
- To make the form more user-friendly and fast to fill out:
  - When the user types **two digits** in the **day** or **month** field, the focus automatically moves to the next input.
  - In the **year** field, the user must type **four digits** to complete it.

- The user can also use the **Enter** key to move forward and the **Backspace** key to go back through the inputs.

- The app is fully **responsive**, adapting to all screen sizes, from the smallest to the largest viewports.

- There's a **count-up animation** between the numbers when the app calculates the result, making the interaction more dynamic.
